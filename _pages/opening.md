#### To Prospective Students 

There remains a significant gap between what modern AI systems can do and what we truly understand about them. My research group aims to help close this gap from two directions:
- **Bottom-up**: building theoretical foundations and first principles for AI. 
- **Top-down**: analyzing state-of-the-art methods and propose theory-inspired new algorithms. 

To me, achieving **concrete understanding** takes precedence over tuning black-box models for improvements. Coming from a statistics background, I believe statistics — along with other theoretical disciplines — has much to contribute to this effort. 
A key step in this process is conducting solid observational studies and formulating novel problems and hypotheses. 
Well-formulated toy settings can serve as powerful bridges between theory and practice. 

I am actively seeking highly motived **PhD/MPhil students** and **research assistants** to join my group. 
Ideal candidates will have a strong theoretical foundation (in statistics, computer science, math, etc.) and hands-on experience in AI.
