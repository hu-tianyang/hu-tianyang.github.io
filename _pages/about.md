I am currently a Postdoc at the National University of Singapore, working with Prof. [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/). In Fall 2025, I will join the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen as an Assistant Professor.

Previously, I was a research scientist at the AI Theory Group of [Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/).
I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University, under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/). Prior to that, I completed my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and B.S. in Math from Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>Statistics and AI</strong>, with the aim of advancing the theoretical understanding of AI and developing theory-inspired new algorithms.
I am particularly interested in:

<ul>
  <li>Statistical Machine Learning</li> 
  <li>Representation Learning</li>
  <li>Deep Generative Modeling</li>
</ul>

I am actively seeking <b>PhD/MPhil students</b> and <b>research assistants</b> with a strong theoretical foundation and hands-on experience in AI to join my group.
If you are interested, please send me an [email](mailto:hutianyang.up@outlook.com) with your CV.
