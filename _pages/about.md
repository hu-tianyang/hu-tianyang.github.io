I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the National University of Singapore, working with Prof. [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and a Research Scientist in the AI Theory Group of [Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/).
I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/), after earning an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and a B.S. in Mathematics from Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on the intersection of <strong>Statistics and AI</strong>, aiming to deepen the theoretical foundations of AI and design theory-inspired algorithms.
I am particularly interested in:

<ul>
  <li>Statistical Machine Learning</li> 
  <li>Representation Learning</li>
  <li>Deep Generative Modeling</li>
</ul>

I am actively seeking <b>PhD/MPhil students</b> and <b>research assistants</b> with a strong theoretical foundation and hands-on experience in AI to join my group.
If you are interested, please send me an [email](mailto:hutianyang.up@outlook.com) with your CV.
